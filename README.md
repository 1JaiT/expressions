# Reflection
Do you think programming terms like expressions, statements, variables, and booleans sound more intimidating than they actually are? How has applying these concepts changed your perception of programing? Explain your answer.

I think that the terms sound more intimidating than what they are, so far I understand it, I just need to get into practice of doing JS. However, I think my perspective has changed because JS seems to be like an actual english dialect that I can communicate with my computer in a way I wasn't before. If that makes sense.
